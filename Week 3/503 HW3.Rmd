# Assignment

Pick something to look at in the nycflights13 data and write up a .Rmd file showing your investigation. Upload both the .Rmd file and the .html file to Canvas. You must use at least once: mutate(), , , and any join. Include at least one nicely formatted plot (   ) and one table (pander). In plots and tables, use "nice" variable names (try out spaces!) and rounded values (<= 3 digits).
This time, include all your code in your output document (echo=TRUE), using comments and line breaks separating commands so that it is clear to a peer what you are doing (or trying to do!). You must write up your observations briefly in words as well.
