# Week 1 /////////////////////////////////////////////////

```{r}
library(pander)
```

Command + enter to run highlighted code, or code where the caret (cursor) is resting

Command + enter repeatedly runs next lines of code

Objects: everything in R is called an object:
```{r chunk one, echo=FALSE}
new.object <- 144
```


Vectors: a vector is a series of elements, such as numbers:
```{r chunk two}
new.object <- c(4, 9, 16, 25, 36)
new.object
```

Matrices, arrays, lists, and dataframes are more complex objects: we will default to dataframes.

#Markdown formatting:
bold/strong emphasis **bold/strong emphasis**
italic/normal emphasis *italic/normal emphasis*

# Header
## Subheader
### Subsubheader
> Block quote from
> famous person

##Lists:
1. Ordered lists
1. Are real easy
  1. Even with sublists
  1. Or when lazy with numbering
  
  * Unordered lists
* Are also real easy
  + Also even with sublists
  
##URLS:
  [URLs are trivial](http://www.uw.edu)
  
  ![pictures too](https://static.miraheze.org/evanswikiwiki/thumb/9/93/GreenEvans_Title.jpg/320px-GreenEvans_Title.jpg)
  
#Chunk Options:
1. echo=FALSE: Keeps R code from being shown in the document
1. eval=FALSE: Shows R code in the document without running it
1. include=FALSE: Hides all output but still runs code
    1. good for setup chunks where you load packages!
1. results='hide': Hides R's (non-plot) output from the document cache=TRUE: Saves 1. results of running that chunk so if it takes a while,
you won't have to re-run it each time you re-knit the document
1. fig.height=5, fig.width=5: modify the dimensions of any plots that are generated in the chunk (units are in inches)  
  
#In-Line R code:
1. Four score and seven years ago is the same as `r 4*20 + 7` years.
```{r}
x <- sqrt(77) # <- is how we assign variables
```
  1. The value of `x` rounded to the nearest two decimals is `r round(x, 2)`.
  1. The value of x rounded to the nearest two decimals is 8.77.
  
#Dates:
format(Sys.Date(), format='%B %d, %Y') says, "format system date as month
name (%B), day-of-month (%d), and four-digit year (%Y): April 03, 2019. See ?strptime for these format codes.
  
# Basic commands:
```{r}
# calls data:
data(cars)
# views a window of the data:
#View(cars)
# for first five rows:
head(cars, 5)
# last five rows:
tail(cars,5)
# display structure of an object
str(cars)
# view a summary of the information (changes depending on the datatype):
summary(cars)
```

#Basic Plots:
```{r}
# histograms:
hist(cars$speed)
hist(cars$dist)

hist(cars$dist,
     xlab = "Distance (ft)", # X axis label
     main = "Observed stopping distances of cars") # Title
```

#Math:
```{r}
( dist_mean  <- mean(cars$dist) )
( speed_mean <- mean(cars$speed) )
```

```{r}
plot(dist ~ speed, data = cars,
     xlab = "Speed (mph)",
     ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     main = "Speeds and stopping distances of cars",
     pch = 16) # Point size
abline(h = dist_mean, col = "firebrick")
abline(v = speed_mean, col = "cornflowerblue")
```

#Swiss Dataset:
```{r}
data(swiss)
pairs(swiss, pch = 8, col = "violet", #this is a useful overview command for smaller datasets
      main = "Pairwise comparisons of Swiss variables")
```

#Pander summary table:
```{r}
pander(summary(swiss), style = "rmarkdown", split.tables = 120) #80 for regular width, 120 for wide slides
```



# Week 2: GGPLOT  /////////////////////////////////////////////////

## Saving files:
```{r}
#save(new.object, file="new_object.RData")
```
R Data files are highly compressed

## Loading files:
```{r}
#load("new_object.RData")
```

## Get working directory:
```{r}
getwd()
```

## Change Working Directory:
```{r}
#setwd("users/Cazvan/Documents")
```

## Can embed a .r file into a a markdown document using source:
source()

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

## Subsetting Data (slicing):

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Pipes (using magrittr) vs. nesting:

These two lines yield the same results, but the first reads in to out, the second reads left to right sequentially:
```{r}
log(mean(gapminder$pop))
gapminder$pop %>% mean() %>% log()
```

## Filerting data:

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(country == "Oman")
```

Let's say we want observations from Oman after 1980 and through 2000:
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country == "Oman" &
    year > 1980 &
    year <= 2000 )
```

## Saving a subset:
```{r}
China <- gapminder %>% filter(country == "China")
head(China, 4)
```

# GGPLOT

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

GGplot has two primary components: layers and aesthetics

```{r}
ggplot(data = China,
    aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  # theme_bw() +
  geom_point()
```

## Aesthetics: setting vs. mapping:

Setting: sets a specific value for a thing
Mapping: tells R to add it's own colors to a set of things (each state is a different color, etc)

## Axis labels, points, no background:

```{r}
ggplot(data = China,
      aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) + # setting aesthetic
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Life expectancy") +
  ggtitle("Life expectancy in China") +
  theme_bw(base_size=18)
```

## Facets:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder,
      aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
        group = country,
        color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Life expectancy") +
  ggtitle("Life expectancy over time") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent)
```

## Saving Plots:

```{r}
lifeExp_by_year <-
  ggplot(data = gapminder,
      aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
        group = country, color = continent)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Life expectancy") +
  ggtitle("Life expectancy over time") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent)
```

Can recall a stored plot by itself, or recall then add layers:
```{r}
lifeExp_by_year +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

## Common Problem: Overplotting:
position_jitter()
```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = year, color = continent)) +
  geom_point()

# vs.

ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = continent, y = year, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.5, height = 2))
```
